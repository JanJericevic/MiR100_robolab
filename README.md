### Dependencies
- **`ROS noetic:`** full desktop version is preferred. Can install other variant dependant on your use case. Make sure to install and initialize [rosdep](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu#:~:text=source%20~%2F.zshrc-,dependencies%20for%20building%20packages,-Up%20to%20now).
- **`(optional) Docker:`** when using the external roscore for controlling and MiR100 internal roscore for monitoring the robot. See [docker instructions](#working-with-docker) for details. 

### Overview
- **`mir_robot:`** [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/web) [package](https://github.com/DFKI-NI/mir_robot#mir_robot) containing the ROS driver and config files for MiR100 robot.
- **`mir_joy_teleop:`** joystick teleoperation package.
- **`mir_rest_api:`** MiR100 REST API. Allows direct requests or requests using a ROS service.

## Installation

### Create a ROS workspace and source it
```
$ mkdir -p ~/MiR100/ws/src
$ cd ~/MiR100/ws/ \
&& catkin_make \
&& source devel/setup.bash

# add workspace to .bashrc
$ echo "source ~/MiR100/ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

You can check if workspace is sourced correctly with:

```
$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home/<youruser>/MiR100/ws/src:/opt/ros/noetic/share
```

### Install the packages
We are using the source install of the `mir_robot` package. For other options see the package [github page](https://github.com/DFKI-NI/mir_robot#mir_robot).

```
# clone mir_robot into the catkin workspace
$ cd ~/MiR100/ws/src/ \
&& git clone -b noetic https://github.com/DFKI-NI/mir_robot.git

# clone this repository into the catkin workspace
$ cd ~/MiR100/ws/src/ \
&& git clone -b main https://github.com/JanJericevic/MiR100_robolab.git

# update and install packages
$ sudo apt update \
&& sudo apt upgrade -y \
&& sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends python3-catkin-lint python3-catkin-tools

# use rosdep to install all dependencies
$ cd ~/MiR100/ws/ \
&& rosdep update \
&& rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y --rosdistro noetic 

```

## Working with Docker:
The `mir_robot` package and in turn `mir_driver` use the external computer roscore to control the MiR100 robot. With the OS wide ROS install you can only simultaneously use either the external computer roscore for controlling the robot or connect to the internal MiR100 computer roscore for monitoring. Docker containers allow you flexibility in your setup: 
- use your computer to control the robot and a Docker image to connect to the robot roscore for monitoring and vice versa
- use Docker containers for both controlling and monitoring the robot
- no need for OS wide ROS install & possibility of switching between ROS versions  

### Install Docker engine
Full install instructions are available at Dockers [official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
Make sure old versions od Docker engine are [uninstalled](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#uninstall-docker-engine).

```
# Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg

# Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key
$ sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
$ sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# set up the repository
$ echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Update the apt package index
$ sudo apt-get update

# install the latest version
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# verify the installation
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```

#### Optional post installation steps
All optional installation steps are available at Dockers [official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).  
Useful post installation step is to manage Docker as a non sudo user. This allow the omission of `sudo` in front of docker commands. When allowing this make sure to be aware of how this [impacts security of your system](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface).

```
# Create the docker group
# On some Linux distributions, the system automatically creates this group when installing Docker Engine using a package manager
$ sudo groupadd docker

# Add your user to the docker group
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated
# or un the following command to activate the changes to groups
$ newgrp docker

# Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo
$ docker run hello-world
```

### Building the image
If all you want is to connect to the MiR100 roscore for monitoring all you need is a ROS Docker image. We will build a custom ROS Docker image complete with the same ROS packages so you have a choice of running the project locally or using Docker containers.

```
# go to the src directory of the workspace
$ cd ~/MiR100/ws/src

# copy the Dockerfile

# then build the Docker image
$ docker build -t <image-name> --build-arg MYUID=$(id -u) --build-arg MYGID=$(id -g) --build-arg MYUSER=$(id -nu) --build-arg MYGROUP=$(id -ng) .

# list you built Docker images
$ docker images

# verify that your <image-name> is among the listed images
```

**NOTE:** if you're on a machine with no OS wide ROS install and don't have a `catkin ws`, build the Docker image at the root of the directory where you copied the ROS packages to. The build commands remain the same.

To avoid permissions issues with shared files between the host computer and the image container, we create a user with `sudo` permissions inside the image. User profile can be changed when building the image (the `build-arg` mentioned above) and inside the Dockerfile.  
The current profile settings are: 
   
> *username*: same as the host username that built the image  
> *password*: same as the username


Depending on your use case you will use the Docker image during development (you plan to regularly modify your codebase) or you will only use it for deployment. For development see the [volume mounting]() section. For deployment see the [copying files]() section.

**TODO**
- dockerfile names
- dockerignore
- entrypoints
- convenience scripts
- useful tags

### Running the image
Starting work directory inside the container is set to `/home/<your-user>/ws`.  
You can open an interactive bash shell with:
```
docker run -it <image-name> bash
```
The above command is ok for simple tasks however more advanced tasks require additional commands.

#### Networking
There are many options for the network settings of a container that you can read about [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings). Depending on your application you may want to use another option, in our case we choose to use the host's network inside the container.

```
docker run -it --net=host <image-name> bash
```

#### GUI applications
ROS workflow is full of visual tools, which means that we need graphics capabilities from inside the container. [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/GUI) mentions a few possible methods. Here we take the **simple but unsecure** method using X server. We expose our xhost so that the container can render to the correct display by reading and writing though the X11 unix socket

```
docker run -it --net=host \
    --env="DISPLAY" \
    --env="QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1" \
    --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" \
    --device /dev/dri \
    <image-name> \
    bash
```
